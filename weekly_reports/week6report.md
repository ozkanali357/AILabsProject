# Week 6 Report

## Hours spent: 10 hours

## What did you do this week?
- Simplified the code and deleted in-depth explanation comments and made a record where users would be able to access and see the commented version in order to better understand the topic and the code.
- Implemented suggestions made in the peer review process.
- Completed finishing touches on the project and made sure features are functioning properly.
- Conducted thorough tests in order to cross-validate RSA encrypt and decrypt functions.
- Improved implementation document, user guide and the test document.
- Refined the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## How did the project move forward?
The project is in completion phase with everything implemented and properly tested. The documents are in hand and are in fine quality and the project is now submission-ready.

## What did you learn this week?
- Acquired skill in completion and editing a project, reviewing every detail prior to submitting.
- Improved capacity in generating comprehensive and informative reports understandable and useful to users.
- Improving the GUI for better usability.

## What was unclear or difficult?
- Including functions in other files within the file I was working on because it reduced pylint quality level.
- Ensuring edge conditions are addressed in the test phase was difficult, but a thorough test was adequate in detecting and correcting any issues still left.
- Balancing finishing touches on the project with high quality code and thorough documentation was a close concern.

## Next steps to be done:
- Do a second peer-review. 
- Finish my code from the second peer review.
- Work for the demonstration.
- Do the course feedback.
