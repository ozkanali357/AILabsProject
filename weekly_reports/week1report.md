# Week 1 Report

## Project Title: RSA Encryption

## Hours Spent: 6 hours

## What have you done this week?
- Choosed project topic: RSA Encryption.
- Wrote the skeleton of the specification document which includes but not limited to the project scope, algorithms to be used, data structures, problem statement, inputs, usage, time and space complexities desired, and references.
- Discussed including both encryption and decryption into the project and decided to focus on encryption for now and will include decryption if possible during the testing.

## How has the project progressed?
- The project goes pretty well for this week. I had some idea about the scope and requirement of the project.
- The specification document is ready, which is ready to be submitted.
- A proper plan was made for the further steps to do the research and first implementation.

## What did you learn this week?
- Gained a deeper understanding of RSA encryption: processes of key generation, encryption, and decryption.
- Gained knowledge in Miller-Rabin Primality Test and Modular Exponentiation algorithms.
- How the documentation and the formatting should be in the project.

## What has been unclear or problematic?
- The project scope seems unclear - whether to include encryption and decryption, both in the project. Presently, I am thinking of focusing on encryption first, then doing the decryption in the testing phase if time allows.
- This is a concern in ensuring the project remains manageable within the given timeframe. I will scale the scope if needed.

## What next?
- Research RSA encryption, Miller-Rabin Primality Test, and Modular Exponentiation in detail.
- Begin to implement key generation and encryption in Python.
- Document the implementation and challenges that I faced.

## Questions and Feedback for the Course Assistant:
- Is the current scope of focusing on encryption first and including decryption in the testing phase acceptable?
- Are there any specific resources or references you recommend for implementing RSA encryption in Python?
