# Week 3 Report

## Hours Spent: 15 hours

## What have you done this week?
In this week, I worked on improving the quality and coverage of RSA encryption and decryption. The specific tasks done included:
- All functions of this project were under unit testing to ensure it is correct and reliable.
- Setup the Coverage tool for assessing test coverage with the purpose to reveal un-tested parts of the code.
Integrated `pylint` in order to follow the coding standard and improve the quality of code.
- Renaming of modules.
- More documentation is involved in every codebase with regard to using them.
 
## How does the project progress?
This week, the project moved ahead by writing unit tests that increased the reliability of the code. I integrated `pylint` for higher code quality and better test coverage.

## What did you learn this week?
- Writing comprehensive unit tests to cover different edge cases, which also improved the code reliability.
How to configure and use the coverage tool to measure test coverage and identify untested parts of the code. How to use pylint in order to maintain coding standards and improve code quality. How to refactor code in response to pylint identification of issues.
- It was challenging to address the issues thrown by `pylint`, long line breaks and adding missing docstrings.
- Correct understanding of usage and implementation of `pylint` and coverage tools took a little more time and effort.

## What next?
Over the coming week, I plan to:
- Reconstruct code on items identified by `pylint` such as docstrings were missing, several long lines of code, placement of imports at the wrong positions.
- Further, test coverage should be fixed to reach 100% for all modules.
- Start with final documentation and user guide of the project.

## Questions and Feedback to the Course Assistant:
- Do you have any suggestions to improve the coverage and code standard with pylint? For example, when I try to add extra tests for edge cases, the ratio of coverage falls.
