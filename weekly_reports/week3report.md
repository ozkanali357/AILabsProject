# Week 3 Report

## Hours Spent: 15 hours

## What have you done this week?
In this week, I worked on enhancing the quality and coverage of RSA encryption and decryption. The specific tasks done included:
- All functions of this project were under comprehensive unit testing to ensure it is correct and reliable.
- Setup the Coverage tool for assessing test coverage with the purpose to reveal un-tested parts of your code.
Integrated `pylint` in order to follow the coding standard and improve the quality of code.
- Reconstructed code on items identified by `pylint` such as docstrings were missing, several long lines of code, placement of imports at the wrong positions, etc
- Renaming of modules followed snake_case naming convention.
- More documentation is involved in every codebase with regard to using them.
 
## How does the project progress?
This week, the project really moved ahead by writing extensive unit tests that increased the reliability of the code. It has integrated `pylint` for higher code quality, better test coverage, and maintaining coding standards, hence making this project much robust and easier to maintain.

## What did you learn this week?
- Writing comprehensive unit tests to cover different edge cases, which also improved the code reliability.
How to configure and use the coverage tool to measure test coverage and identify untested parts of the code. How to use pylint in order to maintain coding standards and improve code quality. Why coding conventionssuch as snake_case naming and proper import position are important. How to refactor code in response to pylint identification of issues.
- It was challenging to address all the issues thrown by `pylint`, long line breaks and adding missing docstrings.
- Correct understanding of usage and implementation of `pylint` and coverage tools took a little more time and effort.

## What next?
Over the coming week, I plan to:
- Further, test coverage should be fixed to reach 100% for all modules.
- More refactoring to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- Start with final documentation and user guide of the project.

## Questions and Feedback to the Course Assistant:
- Do you have any suggestions to improve the coverage and code standard with pylint? For example, when I try to add extra tests for edge cases, the ratio of coverage falls.
