### Peer Review
I cloned the project repository to my laptop. It is the same topic as my project but I went over the project's topic and what it is all about. I went over the project's code and tests in detail to be familiar with every class and method. I tried to run the project and its tests to find bugs. I provided in-depth feedback. This was in the form of improvement proposals, bugs found, and constructive notes. I put up the feedback as a GitHub Issue and referenced it in Labtool.
