# Week 5 Report

## Hours Spent: 12 hours

## What have you done this week?
- Added more commenting to the code to make it more understandable.
- Changed class names to PascalCase naming and file names to snake_case naming.
- Removed trailing whitespaces and broke long lines for better formatting.
- Used different commenting styles for functions and details to make the code more readable.
- Improved the import system so that the files can run easier.
- Completed peer review 1.
- Wrote the testing document, implementation document, and user guide.
- Made the project code get a 10/10 code quality from pylint.

### Peer Review
I cloned the project repository to my machine. It was about the same topic as mine but I read the project's topic and what it is about. I went through the project's code and tests carefully to know about every class and method. I attempted to run the project and its tests to see if there are any issues. I gave thorough feedback. This was in the form of improvement suggestions, bugs encountered, and positive comments. I posted the feedback as a GitHub Issue and linked it in Labtool.

## How has the project progressed?
The project has progressed well this week. The code is of much higher quality, and proper documentation has been created.

## What did you learn this week?
- Improved my understanding of code readability and quality.
- Learned how to use pylint for coding standards and code quality improvement.
- Gained experience in preparing detailed documentation, including testing documentation, implementation documentation, and user manuals.
- Gained experience in performing peer reviews and providing constructive feedback.

## What has been unclear or problematic?
- Ensuring the balance of detail in documentation and comments that it is informative but not wordy.
- Ensuring that all edge cases are caught in the tests and the code is pylint compliant.

## What next?
- Continue refining the code and documentation according to any feedback.
- Prepare for final submission of the project.

## Questions and Feedback to the Course Assistant:
- Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the code and make it more readable?
- Are there any additional tests or edge cases that you believe I should add?
