I changed the commenting to improve the coding quality and to make it easier.

for classes, I changed the names to PascalCase naming style
for files, i changed them to snake_case naming style
cut trailing whitespaces and long lines
used differing commenting styles on functions and details
worked on the importing systematic to run the files with less effort
